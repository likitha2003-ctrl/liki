    <h1 id="nigga">MY BATMAN</h1>
    <h1 id="tony">TONY SABDIEL OH LORD HEAVENSS!!! HE IS AHHHH
        underneath a starlit sky
whispers soft, our laughs high
On the rooftop, hearts tangled
Fireworks bloom , our love doubled

Sneaking glances, time stand stills
Every kiss a thrill , a chill
In the night , it's just us two
With every spark , I fall even more for you

Your smile , a glow , warm and bright
Like fireflies dancing in the night
Your smile , a ray that lights the night
A gentle glow , so pure so bright

with every laugh , the stars align
In your presence , everything feels divine
Together we're a hidden spark
Two souls dancing in the dark
In the mirror's gaze, I see my tears
A reflection of my own self filled with love and fears
You whisper cold truths, but your touch so warm
you make me cry and you say you mean no harm

You wound me with actions, yet I still stay
chasing the shadows of your love which seems to fade away
Caught in the cycle of hope and despair
A love that hurts, yet I still crave.

    </h1>

    <p>In your smile , I find happiness of my own
        A place where I feel I belong
        You're my home...my constant star! 
        No matter where you go...I close my eyes and there you are</p>
        <p class="batman">In the midst of chaos , you're the calm
            A soothing touch , so warm
            You're my home....in my hearts own land....
            I know you don't believe in forever 
            But together we always stand!
            </p>
